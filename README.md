# Dev Config

Here is a repository for development-related configuration files, like:

* .bashrc
* .bash_aliases

...etc.


Best to set this repo to track from the home directory (`~/`). Make sure not to push breaking configs, or personal information.

### Important:

*The `.gitignore` is set to ignore everything by default!*
Make sure to add rules for any files you want to push.
